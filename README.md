# personal blog

This app allows for a user to make posts, edit them and it autimatically saves posts to the user's local browser storage until the the user manually deletes the post.

No instructions needed. It is intuitive

So this was a straight forward based on labs we have done before aside from editing the posts in place. This has a challenge for me, before whenever I made an edit, the new edited post would appear at the end of the list, so I did a lot of googling to figure out how to get it to stay in it's same place. I have two functions to handle the edits I need to go back and comment out the edit function that doesn't work as expected.
